   This routine opens a socket connection to the broker, which uses an file 
   descriptor. When called from the shim library, it can be called by code 
   like this:

   close(1)
   open("....) 
   write( 1,   ... ) 

   The above assumes and requires fd returned by open will be 1, which is 
   normally safe, however, if the broker connection is established before the 
   next file is opened, then the socket will use the first available file 
   descriptor which could be 0, 1, or 2. 

   When avoid_std_fds is set, a number of file descriptors are associated with 
   /dev/null prior to connecting to the broker to ensure that the fd assigned
   to that socket will not be one of the standard ones. When called from 
   well-behaved code such as a single C-program, this is unnecessary.
